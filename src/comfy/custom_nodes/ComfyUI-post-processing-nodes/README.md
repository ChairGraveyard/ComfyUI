Both images have the workflow attached, and it is included so feel free to use it as base

## Node List

 - ArithmeticBlend: Blends two images using arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and difference.
 - Blend: Blends two images together with a variety of different modes
 - Blur: Applies a Gaussian blur to the input image, softening the details
 - CannyEdgeDetection: Applies Canny edge detection to the input image
 - Chromatic Aberration: Shifts the color channels in an image, creating a glitch aesthetic
 - **ColorCorrect: Adjusts the color balance, temperature, hue, brightness, contrast, saturation, and gamma of an image**
 - Dissolve: Creates a grainy blend of two images using random pixels based on a dissolve factor.
 - DodgeAndBurn: Adjusts image brightness using dodge and burn effects based on a mask and intensity.
 - FilmGrain: Adds a film grain effect to the image, along with options to control the temperature, and vignetting
 - Glow: Applies a blur with a specified radius and then blends it with the original image. Creates a nice glowing effect.
 - **KuwaharaBlur: Applies an edge preserving blur, creating a stunning and unique effect.**
 - Parabolize: Applies a color transformation effect using a parabolic formula
 - PencilSketch: Converts an image into a hand-drawn pencil sketch style.
 - **PixelSort: Rearranges the pixels in the input image based on their values, and input mask. Creates a cool glitch like effect.**
 - Pixelize: Applies a pixelization effect, simulating the reducing of resolution
 - **Quantize: Set and dither the amount of colors in an image from 0-256, reducing color information**
 - Sharpen: Enhances the details in an image by applying a sharpening filter
 - **Solarize: Inverts image colors based on a threshold for a striking, high-contrast effect**
 - Vignette: Applies a vignette effect, putting the corners of the image in shadow

**Bolded Nodes are my Personal Favorites, and highly recommended to expirement with**

## Combine Nodes

By default `post_processing_nodes.py` should have all of the combined nodes. If you want a subset of nodes, you can run

    python combine_files.py [--files FILES [FILES ...]] [--output OUTPUT]

or just run

    python combine_files.py -h

for more help

## Old Nodes

Some nodes have been have been added to the main repo, feel free to use those instead as they work perfectly fine. Old versions are still kept around for backwards compatability.
